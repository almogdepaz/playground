# roi monitor

####work in progress !!!

end goal is to learn how to fetch smart contract data from etherume 
using golang and the geth rpc just cause i dident find any good examples 
out there on how to do it.

currently uses uniswap factory contract to discover tokens and fetch balances for those tokens 

next up fetching the initial token quantities for the roi calculation

(this would probably be much easier using web3js but that's kinda the point of this repo)
